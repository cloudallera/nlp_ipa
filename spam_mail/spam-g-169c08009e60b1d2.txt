Basic SAP FICO integration topics


Hi Alex,


Many experienced consultants stumble on some of the basic integration questions in FICO if there is a twist.

Question 1:

Business requirement to trigger  separate GL accounts based on different material in SD billing. Material 1 to post to Sale account 300000 and Material 2 to post to 300001.

This question is a real application of your configuration knowledge and how to trigger this, but many consultants are not even able to answer this basic question.

Answer : This is possible by configuring different Material Grp/Acct key set up in the VKOA set up.

Question 2:

Where is the Material Grp/Acct key assigned ?

Here again many consultants fumble or not aware of basic concepts

Answer : The Material Grp is assigned in the sales view of the material master. Account key is assigned to the SD pricing procedure to various condition types.

To answer and clarify all your concepts get the SAP ECC FICO Configuration Set.

At a price of 150 USD - only for next 3days.
